  <h1>Journal Day 1</h1>
  <p>So far my knowledge of coding and using VS code and github is very limited. I'm starting to understand how little I actually know. Things I hope to learn this week are using hot key commands quickly and confidently, memorizing important commands from the command line cheat sheet, and making sure I know how to use github. </p>
